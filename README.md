A program to find the shortest path between two countries

To use: dump the files into a folder, compile using your favorite C++ programming application, and watch it go!
Currently, there's no user interface. If you want to find a specific path, write the following function into main:

shortest_path("start_country", "end_country", prev, countries)

If you need help w/ spelling, country_borders.txt has all the country names :D
